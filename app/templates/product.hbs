        Definitely read the instructions about painting, decorating, pinstriping,
        or applying decals to your helmet. Never hang your helmet on the motorcycle's mirrors,
        turn signals, or backrest. The inner liner can easily be damaged from such handling.
        In fact, avoid carrying a spare helmet on your motorcycle, unless it's well protected or on
        your passenger's head. Even the bumps and jarring from normal riding can damage a spare.
        If it is strapped near hot engine parts or exhaust pipes, the inner liner may distort or
        melt at the hot spot. The outer shell may not show the damage, but if you've seen the effects of
        a foam drink cup placed too near excessive heat, you can understand what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you take your helmet off, find a flat, secure place for it. You could set it on the ground,
        secure it on a rack, or stow it on a shelf. On some bikes, putting it on the fuel tank may expose it to fumes.
        If you place it on the seat, make sure it won't fall off. If you plan to use a CB radio when you ride,
        find a model that doesn't require drilling speaker holes in the outer shell.
        Before you purchase your speakers, check with your state's laws regulating their use in helmets.
        Some states prohibit them.
